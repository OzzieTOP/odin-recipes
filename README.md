Repo for html assignment "Project: Recipes" from The Odin Project

Prior to building the page:
For this project I plan to use what I've learned in the html course so far
to include things like headings, anchor tags, img tags and others.

After building the page (reflection):
I feel like I learned a lot more than I expected with this assignment. Some 
was repetative copy/paste, but actually putting all the tags and formatting 
into practice really helped to clarify the html that I've learned so far.

In addition to the html that I've learned, I also got to practice the different 
git commit flags (-c and -a) and I learned how to publish my repo to the web.
