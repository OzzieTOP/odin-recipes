        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is my take on what is currently the world's most trendy taco recipe. 
            Seriously, it's blowing up everywhere and when you make these you're going 
            to understand what all the fuss is about. Start with a batch of my Beef 
            Birria and then combine this super savory, aromatic consomé with amazing 
            beef and cheese tacos to take it up to another level.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>For the Consomé:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups reserved sauce from Beef Birria recipe</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced carrots</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced celery</li>
            <li>½ cup diced cabbage</li>
         </ul>   
        <h3>For the Tacos:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups shredded Beef Birria</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons reserved beef fat from Beef Birria recipe, or more as needed</li>
            <li>8 (5 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups freshly grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped white onion, or to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 medium lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
            Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a 
            slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice 
            of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side 
            up on top of cheese.
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until 
            cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice 
            of cheese. </li>
        </ol>
